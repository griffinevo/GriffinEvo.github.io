    I am a statistical programmer at AstraZeneca working on research
    and development related to respiratory, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
    Prior to joining AstraZeneca in 2020, I performed research in evolutionary
    quantitative genetics. I received my PhD in Evolutionary Genetics from Uppsala
    University in 2015, and held positions as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the
    University of Turku, Uppsala University and the University of Queensland. I work
    with and practise a number of programming languages, mostly using R and SAS
    for statistical analysis, data processing and data visualisation. I also use
    HTML, CSS and JavaScript for front-end web development, and XML and
    Kotlin/Java for Android app development, and have dabbled with Python, Perl
    and LaTeX.
