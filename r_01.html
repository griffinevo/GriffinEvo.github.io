    <div id="r" class="section level1">
    <h1>R</h1>
    <p><strong>R is a programming language</strong> widely used for data-oriented tasks. It was designed specifically with statistical programming in mind and is popular among statisticians, data scientists and researchers. It is well suited to tasks such as sorting, filtering and joining datasets, modifying, deriving and processing variables, producing summary statistics, figures, tables and datasets, and performing complex statistical analyses. Thanks to add-ons such as <em>RMarkdown</em> and <em>Shiny</em>, it can also be used to produce reports in html, pdf and word formats, presentations, tutorials and quizzes, websites and web-based apps all with R code intertwined into their development.</p>
    <p>R is used to write <strong>source code</strong>; code written in a human-readable or “high-level” programming language, providing instructions to the computer. Computers will then read this source code and perform the tasks it specifies. As an example, we may wish to simulate a simple coin-toss experiment. The code should simulate 20 flips of a coin and return the number of times heads occurs. Source code to perform this simulation could be written in R as:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span class="kw">sum</span>(<span class="kw">sample</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;H&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;T&quot;</span>), <span class="dt">size =</span> <span class="dv">20</span>, <span class="dt">replace =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>)<span class="op">==</span><span class="st">&quot;H&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
    <p>That code would make the computer perform three processes. First it would generate 20 outcomes by randomly sampling from the values <code>H</code> and <code>T</code>. The computer would compare each of those 20 values to the value <code>H</code> returning a value of true or false for each case. Finally it would return the number of trials where the outcome was heads (because <code>sum()</code> will interpret logical values and 1 or 0 for true or false).</p>
    <div id="the-r-interpreter" class="section level2">
    <h2>The R interpreter</h2>
    <p>The R code for a coin toss simulation is a fairly simple piece of code to read. You can probably figure out what some parts of that code are doing even without knowing R. For example, you can probably guess that <code>sample()</code> is telling the computer to do some sampling, <code>size</code> is telling the computer what the sample size should be and <code>replace</code> is telling it to sample with replacement. The reason it is easy to read that code is because R is a “high-level” programming language. This means it is designed to be very human-readable. Unfortunately, while being human-readable is a good thing for programmers, that means computers do not understand it all; computers understand <strong>machine code</strong> (typically binary). To make source code usable, we have to translate it into machine code.</p>
    <p>There are three main approaches to translating source code. Compiled and assembled languages both use software, a <strong>compiler</strong> or <strong>assembler</strong> respectively, to create an executable file of machine code. Executable files can then be run on computers without the source code and compiler/assembler present. Interpreted languages on the other hand use software called an <strong>interpreter</strong>. With interpreted languages, <strong>such as R</strong>, an interpreter receives source code and translates it on execution. This is useful for interactive programming, where source code is developed or tasks performed on the fly, but requires both source code and an interpreter to be present if R is to be used.</p>
    <p>Before you can start using R and learning the language, you first need to set up with the <strong>R interpreter</strong>. The R interpreter can be downloaded from the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) homepage and installed on your computer. This will install the interpret and an application called the <strong>console</strong>. The console is a command-line style terminal used to interact with the interpreter; we type and submit R code here, which the interpreter communicates to the computer, and the results are returned. <span class="do">Install the R interpreter, open the console, type <code>print(&quot;hello, world!&quot;)</code> in the bottom line (next to the <code>&gt;</code>) and press enter.</span> Here you used <code>print()</code> to make the computer print the value <code>hello, world!</code> to the console.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="mathematical-operations" class="section level2">
    <h2>Mathematical operations</h2>
    <p>Among the most basic tasks to perform with R are simple calculations. All we need to perform these in R are numbers and <strong>mathematical operators</strong>, all of which can be found on your keyboard. Mathematical operators are just special characters that tell the computer to perform normal mathematical tasks such as addition, subtraction etc.. The most important are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>+</code> adds; <code>x+y</code> is <em>x</em> plus <em>y</em></li>
    <li><code>-</code> subtracts; <code>x-y</code> is <em>x</em> minus <em>y</em></li>
    <li><code>*</code> multiplies; <code>x*y</code> is <em>x</em> times <em>y</em></li>
    <li><code>/</code> divides; <code>x/y</code> is <em>x</em> divided by <em>y</em></li>
    <li><code>^</code> exponentiates; <code>x^y</code> is <em>x</em> to the power of <em>y</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>R will perform mathematical operations in the standard order of operations used in mathematics; operations within parentheses, then exponentiation, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (also from left to right). Parentheses, <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>, are always treated in this way in R; it will perform any processes within parentheses first. <span class="do">To practice using the console and learn the mathematical operators, write and submit source code to calculate:</span></p>
    <div class="do">
    <ul>
    <li>Four times six</li>
    <li>18 divided by two</li>
    <li>Five plus six, times 12</li>
    <li>Five times three, plus four-squared</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
    <p>Each expression should be written then submitted, pressing <em>enter</em>, before writing the next. Results should have been returned to the console on the line immediately below the executed code. You should have written and submitted four lines of code that look something like this:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span class="dv">4</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="dv">6</span></span>
    <span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span class="dv">18</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="dv">2</span></span>
    <span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>(<span class="dv">5</span><span class="op">+</span><span class="dv">6</span>)<span class="op">*</span><span class="dv">12</span></span>
    <span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>(<span class="dv">5</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="dv">3</span>)<span class="op">+</span><span class="dv">4</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="dv">2</span></span></code></pre></div>
    <p>Sometimes you will see that the last line has <code>+</code> at the left side (where the <code>&gt;</code> is normally) and output has not been returned; this means you have submitted an incomplete expression and the interpreter is waiting for you to finish. Submitting the below code would cause this as the closing parenthesis is missing. You can solve this by submitting the missing code, <code>)</code>, or pressing <em>esc</em>. To see, resubmit and edit previously submitted code, navigate up (and down) using the keyboard arrows in the console.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div id="rstudio" class="section level2">
    <h2>RStudio</h2>
    <p>While the console included with the R interpreter is a useful tool for quick and simple interactive programming, you can probably imagine that working by typing code directly into the console becomes less viable for more complex projects. To make life easier, programmers will use an <strong>editor</strong>. An editor is simply a plain-text document where we write, edit and develop code to perform tasks. While any text editor, even Word, could do this, it is best to use something g designed for the purpose. The R application that came bundled with the interpreter, the same application where we find the console includes an editor. <span class="do">Open the R application and go to <em>file</em> &gt; <em>new script</em>. You should now have both the console and an editor open. Type the following expressions into the editor, putting each on to a new line. Run each line by putting the cursor on the line, or highlighting the whole expression, and pressing <em>ctrl</em> + <em>R</em>.</span></p>
    <div class="do">
    <ul>
    <li>Divide 17 minus five by two</li>
    <li>Multiply 42 plus 16 by five over six (five-sixths)</li>
    <li>Two to the power of three to the power of four</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
    <p>As with the console, each new expression should be on a new line. Pressing <em>enter</em> now adds a line but does not execute the code, instead the code is kept in the editor and can be repeatedly run, read and edited. Pressing <em>ctrl</em> + <em>R</em> with the cursor on a lone that contains code, or when code is highlighted, causes that code to execute. Your script should look like the following:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>(<span class="dv">17-5</span>)<span class="op">/</span><span class="dv">2</span></span>
    <span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>(<span class="dv">42</span><span class="op">+</span><span class="dv">16</span>)<span class="op">*</span>(<span class="dv">5</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="dv">6</span>)</span>
    <span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a><span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="dv">4</span></span></code></pre></div>
    <pre><code>## [1] 6
    ## [1] 48.33333
    ## [1] 2.417852e+24</code></pre>
    <p>Note that white space (<em>between</em> data values, operators, names etc.) is not important in R. You could very much write these as, for example, <code>(42 + 16) * (5 / 6)</code> if you want, but <code>(4 2 + 1 6) * (5 / 6)</code> would not work as there are spaces <em>within</em> values. White space should be used to make code more readable and neatly arranged.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The R editor is more useful than the console for serious development, but even this isn’t the tool that most programmers are using. Most are using third party applications as development environments. Perhaps the most popular of these among R programmers is <strong>RStudio</strong>. (RStuido can be downloaded)[#] and installed to run locally. You can also run RStudio through a browser on the <a href="#">RStudio Cloud</a>. Both of these are great options and which you prefer is up to you - local installation takes away the reliance on internet connects allowing you to work on the move, while RStudio Cloud means your programs can be accessed (because they are saved on the RStudio Cloud) and run by logging into any computer. Cloud storage of programs can also be managed by using Dropbox, Drive, iCloud etc. meaning you can get the best of both. Sometimes you may not have the rights to install applications on your computer so RStudio Cloud may be your only option. <span class="do">If you can, download and install RStudio now or create an account and login to RStudio Cloud, then open RStudio.</span></p>
